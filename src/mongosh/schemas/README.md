# Schema Files

> [Important!] DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES!

If you are creating an updated schema, copy the most recent version, and name your new version appropriatly See [Our Mongo Standards](../../../STANDARDS.md) for version naming standards.

After creating a new schema file, you should edit the corresponding file in the [Config Folder](../config/) so that your new version will be applied during migrations.
